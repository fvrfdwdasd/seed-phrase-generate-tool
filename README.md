## Overview
Seed Phrase Generator (SeedGen) is a tool designed to create a unique set of words that can be used to seed a cryptocurrency wallet, enabling users to securely store and access their digital assets. These seed phrases are typically made up of a sequence of 12 randomly generated words that act as a backup for the wallet.
The program is designed to search for a lost or forgotten wallet with preserved cryptocurrency.

## Features

- Generation of seed phrases of 12 words
- Getting the wallet address from the seed phrase
- Checking wallet balance BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE
